### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shi-Rong (Louis) Liu, and I am a Senior Engineer. My engineering interests are mainly in the area of general computer science, and user-friendly software engineering. In my spare time, I dabble in tennis, scuba diving and travels. 

I like to explore user-friendly utilities making life smoothly.
